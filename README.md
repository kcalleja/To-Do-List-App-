# To-Do-List-App-

The purpose of project is a project using only HTML, CSS, & Javascript. This allows the user to input task and delete and check off tasks when they are completed. This can be redesigned based on users prefered visual desire. The main purpose was to build a simple yet effective project that could be used on a day to day basis. For me i tend to have the need to constantly write what I need to accomplish on a day to day basis. This application would make doing this simpler for me.
